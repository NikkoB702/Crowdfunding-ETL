# Crowdfunding-ETL

# Overview

As Independent Funding grows, so does their database. Weâ€™ve been assigned the task of moving all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database. To accomplish this feat we needed to extract, transform and clean the data. Next, we created an ERD and through Postgres was able to create our table schema and load data accordingly. We were eventually able to perform and SQL Analysis with our work.
